Game Of Life Widget
-------------------

This is a library for embedding an HTML5 Canvas-driven Game of Life simulator in your web page. It was developed for a class assignment at Temple University.

The repository is a work in progress, but the code is completely usable. Please see the following page for detailed examples and documentation: [Documentation and Examples](http://cis-linux2.temple.edu:8080/SP18_3344_tuh35975/tutorial/index.html)
